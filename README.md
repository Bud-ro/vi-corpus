# vi-corpus

A large collection of `.vi`, `.ctl`, `.lvlib`, `.lvclass`, `.lvproj` and the
other files the LabVIEW™ software saves, vendored from public repositories
together with their licenses and the assets they refer to.

Each upstream repository lives under `sources/<owner>__<repo>/` with its own
tree layout preserved, so relative links between VIs, controls, libraries,
classes and projects resolve as they did upstream. Next to the tree:

- `LICENSE.md`, the upstream license file copied verbatim;
- `manifest.json`, the repository URL, the vendored commit, the license's SPDX
  identifier, the fetch date, every file kept (path, size, sha256, and whether it
  was kept for its extension, as a reference from another kept file, or as part
  of the tree), files left out for size, and references that point outside the
  repository (`<vilib>` paths and absolute paths);
- `vi-package-manifest.json`, when the repository ships VI Package Manager
  packages (`.vip`) or configurations (`.vipc`): for each one its path, size,
  sha256 and raw-download URL at the vendored commit, every zip member with
  size, CRC-32 and sha256, and the text of its `spec` and `config.xml` members.
  The packages themselves are not stored; they are re-saves of the VIs already
  in the tree, and the manifest is enough to fetch and verify them.

`sources.json` lists every vendored source; `candidates.json` lists public
repositories that are not vendored, with the reason: no license file, a
non-commercial or non-redistributable license, NI product content, no LabVIEW
files at the pinned commit, or every file a byte-identical copy of another
source's. `corpus.json` names the file extensions the corpus collects. Beyond
those, a tree keeps every file another kept file refers to (PTH0 path records,
LabVIEW XML `URL` attributes, file names in TestStand files) and the rest of
the tree except installers, archives, VI Package Manager packages, FPGA
bitfiles, build and IDE caches, office documents, video, 3D models and
unreferenced files over 1 MB, so a project's assets stay in place.

Files are redistributed under their upstream licenses only; this repository
adds no license of its own. Only sources with an explicit license file are
vendored. Mirrors of NI-shipped product content (`vi.lib`, `instr.lib`) and
sources under NI's sample-code terms are not.

## Checking out a few sources

The repository is plain git; a partial clone with a sparse checkout takes only
the sources named:

```
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/Bud-ro/vi-corpus
cd vi-corpus
git sparse-checkout set sources/picotech__picosdk-ni-labview-examples
```
