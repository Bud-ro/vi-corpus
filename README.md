# vi-corpus

LabVIEW source files vendored from public repositories, with their licenses,
for measuring the [labwright](https://github.com/Bud-ro/labwright) RSRC reader.

Each upstream repository lives under `sources/<owner>__<repo>/` with its own
tree layout preserved, so relative links between VIs, controls, libraries,
classes and projects resolve as they did upstream. Next to the tree:

- `LICENSE.md`, the upstream license file copied verbatim;
- `manifest.json`, the repository URL, the vendored commit, the license's SPDX
  identifier, the fetch date, every file kept (path, size, sha256, and whether it
  was kept for its extension, as a reference from another kept file, or as part
  of the tree), files left out for size, and references that point outside the
  repository (`<vilib>` paths and absolute paths).

`sources.json` lists every vendored source; `candidates.json` lists public
repositories that are not vendored, with the reason: no license file, a
non-commercial or non-redistributable license, NI product content, no LabVIEW
files at the pinned commit, or every file a byte-identical copy of another
source's. `corpus.json` names the file extensions the corpus collects. Beyond
those, a tree keeps every file another kept file refers to (PTH0 path records,
LabVIEW XML `URL` attributes, file names in TestStand files) and the rest of
the tree except installers, archives, VIPM packages, FPGA bitfiles, build and
IDE caches, office documents, video, 3D models and unreferenced files over
1 MB, so a project's assets stay in place.

Files are redistributed under their upstream licenses only; this repository
adds no license of its own. Only sources with an explicit license file are
vendored. Mirrors of NI-shipped product content (`vi.lib`, `instr.lib`) and
sources under NI's sample-code terms are not.

## Using it

The repository is plain git. To check out a few sources without the rest:

```
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/Bud-ro/vi-corpus
cd vi-corpus
git sparse-checkout set sources/picotech__picosdk-ni-labview-examples
```

labwright pins a commit of this repository in `corpus/repos.json` and fetches
the sources it tests against with `dart run tool/fetch_corpus.dart`; new sources
are added with `dart run tool/vendor_corpus.dart <this directory> owner/repo@sha`.
